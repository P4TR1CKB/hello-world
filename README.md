# hello-world

Hello all ;) 

I am just stepping through the GitHub Turtorial...

The Turtorial says I should write some lines about myself. So be it ;) 
I am a fully starter in Coding. So far I have done some groundwork in Swift and Javascript (alongside html and css of course). 
My current goal is to dive deeper in web-development in general and particular to customize dynamics crm 365. 

That being said I am looking forward to use GitHub for my following hobby projects :D 

Live long and prosper.
